# Programming Construct

- A Programming Construct is to control the order/flow in which instructions are executed<br/>


# Programming Statement

- In programming languages, the expression which translates to an instruction is called a programming statement or just statement<br/>


### Programming Constructs Classification

- Sequences<br/>
- A sequence construct tells the CPU (processor) which statement is to be executed next.<br/>

- Selection<br/>
1. A selection statement provides for selection 
between alternatives<br/>
2. A program can take certain route 
depending on a situation and selection 
statements help in choosing between the 
routes.<br/>

-Selection Statement Types<br/>
1. If statements<br/>
2. Case Statements<br/>
3. Pattern Matching<br/>

- Repetition<br/>
- A repetition construct causes a group of one or 
more program statements to be invoked 
repeatedly until some end condition is met.<br/>

- Repetition Statement Types<br/>
1. Fixed count loops - repeat a predefine number 
of times. <br/>

-for (( … )) do done<br/>

2. Variable count loops - repeat an unspecified <br/>
number of times. <br/>

-while [ … ] do done<br/>


#  Functions<br/>

•Functions in Bash Scripting are a great way to 
reuse code. <br/>
•Think of a function as a small script within a 
script. It's a small chunk of code which you may 
call multiple times within your script. They are 
particularly useful if you have certain tasks which 
need to be performed several times.<br/>



#  Arrays<br/>
-An array is a systematic arrangement of the 
same type of data.<br/> 
-But in Shell script Array is a variable which contains multiple values may be of same type or different type since by default in shell script everything is treated as a string.<br/> 
-An array is zero-based i.e. indexing start with 0.<br/>

6. Dictionaries

# Dictionary / associative arrays / hash map<br/>
-very useful data structures<br/> 
-Dictionary are key value map similar to
HaspMap in Java or the one in python<br/>
